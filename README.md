I'm proficient in the following languages: C++, Java, JS, Python, and I'm learning TS, Rust, Nix, Lua, and anything else that seems half-interesting and I can make a project out of

I'm also very experienced with DevOps tools like Bash, Git, Docker/Podman, and CI/CD through GitHub Actions (because I try to automate as much of the tedium as I can so I can actually achieve something with the little time I am focused on any specific side project)

I have a homelab turning five years old soon that involves Docker Compose and Debian machines that run a bunch of services, some public-facing and some behind Tailscale.

I'm also in school for a BSc in Computer Science at the University of London where every single module is either a Python web app or a Jupyter notebook

Currently in the process of learning Nix and NixOS to prep for Summer of Nix! Current goal (after graduation) is to turn my entire homelab set up into a flake which you can follow [here](https://github.com/bwfiq/dotfiles)
